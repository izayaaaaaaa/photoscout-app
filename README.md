# PhotoScout App Development Challenge

## Overview

The "photoscout-app" is a React Native mobile application that focuses on location-based services. The project is structured to facilitate the development of a cross-platform mobile app with a focus on user experience and functionality. The architecture is designed to support a modern, scalable, and maintainable application that provides a rich user experience for location-based services.

The project structure includes:

- **Root Directory**: Contains high-level project files such as `README.md` and `developer-challenge.pdf`.
- **photoscout-app Directory**: The main directory where the application code resides.
  - **api**: Contains files related to API calls for interacting with a backend service.
  - **assets**: Holds images and other static assets used within the application.
  - **components**: Contains reusable React components that build the UI of the application.
  - **contexts**: Includes context files for managing global and custom location contexts using React's Context API.

## ToDo

### Remaining Requirements

- Present a sorted list of all locations based on distance (not sure on whose distance?)
- Include unit tests to validate critical app functions, ensuring robustness.

### Additional Features

- Search marker should be draggable
- Clicking a marker should show more details
- A detailed view of a marker should give the option to refocus the map view to its respective marker
- Error handling for invalid locations
- Make the UI more aesthetically pleasing
